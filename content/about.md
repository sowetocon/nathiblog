## About me

I am a human being driven by love for others. I believe love is the only thing that could relief us from our daily pains as humans. We are not perfect. Let us try to be more forgiving and understanding to each other.

Love is the only hope we have if we ought to move on with peace and respect for all. - Nathi

I am currently involved in the following projects:
- [SowetoCon](https://www.sowetocon.africa)
- [Mentoring](https://vulaops.zulipchat.com/)
- Equal Love
- UbuntuNairs
