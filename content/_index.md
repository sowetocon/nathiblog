## Hola, welcome to my personal blog.

I am Nathi Mogomotsi. I am a jozi based software security engineer with over ten years experience. I am originally from the rural village in Zeerust, North West.

My other interests include writing, filming, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and blockchain. I use [rust](https://rust-lang.org) as my hacking tool and [python](https://python.org) to build models.
