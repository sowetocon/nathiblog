I created this blog as a way to communicate my thoughts, pains, struggles and some achievements. I would like you to be more understanding when reading this blog as I have no intention to hurt anyone. I do apologize up-front If I ever say things that makes you feel upset or hurt.

I have nothing but love for everyone regardless of their current or past mistakes, color, status, race, gender, language, religion, state of mind, attire, choice of alcohol etc. I call it equal love.
